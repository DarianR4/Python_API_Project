# python_API_challenge

Here lies my bootcamp virtual thrust at the API assignment.  I'll show you some code magic, click inside and see all this.... weather and vacation Py action.


Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."
But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

Part 1
Your final notebook must:

Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each scatter plot.

Part 2
As final considerations:

You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
For Part I, you must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
For Part II, you must include a screenshot of the heatmap you create and include it in your submission.
You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.
For max intensity in the heat map, try setting it to the highest humidity found in the data set.
